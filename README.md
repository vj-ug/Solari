Internet of Things -- Automatic Lock on Your Door

Tracks your GPS and automatically unlocks the door for you as you walk towards it.

Will it not drain down the battery of phone by using GPS?
No! Many people already use their GPS when in car. Just use it for 2 minutes more till you walk towards to your house/office gate.

Uses Microsoft Azure to store information on cloud and connects with your iOS phone (TouchID included feature)
